# Phosphorus Team

The Phosphorus Team is a non-profit non-company organisation dedicated to making and maintaining the [Phosphorus programming language](https://github.com/Phosphorus-Team/Phosphorus-Lang) and various projects related to it. We mostly manage the compiler and some libraries.

We also work to make the decisions about the language, like using JSON to format projects or various quirks about how the syntax works. This being said, we still value your input! Also, our projects *are* open-source. If you have a design suggestion, feel free to leave it under issues. If you have some sort of improvement to make, feel free to leave a pull request!

We also manage the documentation for the project. Where you can find it should be listed under the repo for the compiler, but if not just check the wiki. If it's not in either of those places, we probably haven't made it yet. *Good luck if that's the case*
